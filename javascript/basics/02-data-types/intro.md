# Overview

JavaScript, as a dynamic and loosely typed language, supports a variety of data types. These types can be broadly categorized into primitive types and reference types. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective JavaScript programming.

## Primitive Types

Primitive types in JavaScript are the basic building blocks. They are immutable and hold a single value. There are seven primitive data types:

### `Undefined`

- Represents the absence of a defined value.
- Variables that are declared but not initialized default to `undefined`.

### `Null`

- Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- It is often used to signify "no value" or "value unknown".

### `Boolean`

- Represents a logical entity with two states: `true` and `false`.
- It is used for logical operations and conditions.

### `Number`

- Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
- Includes special values like `Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN` (Not a Number).
- JavaScript uses double-precision floating-point format for numbers.

### `BigInt`

- Represents integers with arbitrary precision.
- Useful for numbers beyond the safe limit for `Number` type.

### `String`

- Represents textual data.
- It's a sequence of characters used to represent text.
- Strings in JavaScript are immutable.

### `Symbol`

- Represents a unique and immutable primitive value.
- Often used as the key of an object property in complex data structures.

## Reference Types (Objects)

Reference types refer to objects. Unlike primitives, reference types can hold multiple values and are mutable.

### `Object`

- The base type of all complex data structures in JavaScript.
- Can be used to store collections of data and more complex entities.

### `Array`

- A global object used to store ordered collections of data.
- Arrays are objects, and their elements can be of any type.

### `Function`

- Functions are objects with the capability of being called.
- They can accept parameters and return a value.

### `Date`

- Used to represent dates and times.
- Provides methods to manage and manipulate dates.

### `RegExp`

- Represents regular expressions.
- Used for pattern matching and text manipulation.

## Structured Data

### `JSON`

- Stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
- A lightweight format for storing and transporting data.
- `JSON` is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

### `ArrayBuffer` and Typed Arrays

- Used for handling binary data.
- `ArrayBuffer` is a raw binary data buffer, while typed arrays are array-like views over an `ArrayBuffer`.

## Type Conversion and Coercion

- JavaScript is dynamically typed, which means variables can be converted to different types automatically (type coercion) or manually (type conversion).
- Understanding how and when JavaScript converts types is crucial for writing predictable code.

This overview provides a foundation for understanding the various data types in JavaScript and their roles in the language's ecosystem. Mastery of these concepts is essential for effective JavaScript programming and for leveraging the language's full potential in web development.
