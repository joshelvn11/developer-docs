# Mocking

## Introduction to Mocking

Mocking in the context of unit testing is a technique used to simulate the behavior of real objects. It allows developers to isolate the code under test, ensuring that tests focus solely on the functionality of that unit without relying on external systems or complex dependencies. By using mock objects, you can mimic the interactions between the code under test and its dependencies, allowing for a controlled testing environment.

### Understanding the Purpose and Benefits of Mocking in Unit Testing

**Purpose of Mocking:**

- **Isolation**: Mocking isolates the unit of code being tested from its external dependencies. This isolation helps ensure that the tests are not affected by the state or behavior of these dependencies.
- **Control**: It provides control over the test environment by allowing you to simulate various scenarios, including error conditions, unavailable services, or edge cases, that would be difficult or time-consuming to set up with real objects.
- **Simplicity**: Tests become simpler to write and understand since they don't involve complex setup, teardown, or configuration of real dependencies.
- **Speed**: Mocking removes the overhead of setting up real dependencies, leading to faster test execution. This is particularly beneficial in continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, where quick feedback is valuable.

**Benefits of Mocking:**

- **Deterministic Tests**: Mocks ensure that tests are deterministic, producing the same results every time they are run, regardless of external factors.
- **Improved Test Coverage**: By mocking dependencies, you can easily test error handling and edge cases that would be difficult to reproduce with real objects.
- **Reduced Costs**: There's no need to maintain a complex infrastructure for testing purposes, as dependencies can be simulated through mocks.
- **Parallel Development**: Mocking allows for the parallel development of features that depend on unimplemented or unavailable services by simulating those services.

### The Difference Between Stubs, Mocks, and Fakes

While the terms stubs, mocks, and fakes are often used interchangeably in the context of testing, they have distinct meanings:

- **Stubs**: Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe not even that. Stubs primarily replace real implementations with simplified versions to satisfy the code's dependencies, without mirroring the exact behavior of the real objects.

- **Mocks**: Mocks are objects that register calls they receive. In test assertion, you can verify on mocks that all the expected actions were performed. Mocks are used to test interactions between components, ensuring that objects receive the expected calls with the correct parameters. They are about behavior rather than state and are used in behavior-driven testing.

- **Fakes**: Fakes are objects with working implementations, but usually simplified and not suitable for production (e.g., an in-memory database). Fakes might be partially functional implementations of a service that are easy to instantiate and use within tests. Unlike stubs and mocks, fakes can have a working implementation but usually take shortcuts that make them unsuitable for production use.

**Summary**: The key difference lies in their use; stubs answer calls during tests, mocks verify interactions between objects, and fakes have simplified functional implementations. Each has its place in a tester's toolkit, and understanding when to use one over the others is crucial for effective testing.

## The unittest.mock Module

The `unittest.mock` module in Python is a powerful tool for replacing parts of your system under test with mock objects and making assertions about how they were used. The module provides a core `Mock` class removing the need for using a real object in your tests and offers a way to simulate and assert the interaction between different parts of your application. Here's a detailed look at `unittest.mock`, including examples to illustrate its usage.

### Core Components of `unittest.mock`

#### The `Mock` Class

The `Mock` class is the heart of the `unittest.mock` module. It can simulate any object in your system and is designed to mimic its behavior.

**Example Usage**:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Create a mock object
mocked_function = Mock(return_value='mocked response')

# Use the mock object
result = mocked_function('arg1', 'arg2')

# Assertions
assert mocked_function.called  # Check if the mock was called
mocked_function.assert_called_once_with('arg1', 'arg2')  # Check if it was called with the specified arguments
assert result == 'mocked response'  # Verify the return value
```

#### The `MagicMock` Class

`MagicMock` is a subclass of `Mock` equipped with default implementations of the magic methods in Python. This feature makes it suitable for mocking objects that need to support magic methods, such as item assignment or string representation.

**Example Usage**:

```python
from unittest.mock import MagicMock

# Create a MagicMock object
magic_mocked_object = MagicMock()
magic_mocked_object.__str__.return_value = 'MagicMocked Object'

# Use and assert
print(str(magic_mocked_object))  # Prints: MagicMocked Object
magic_mocked_object.__str__.assert_called_once()
```

#### The `patch` Decorator/Context Manager

The `patch` function is used to temporarily replace the real objects in your code with mock or MagicMock objects during a test. It can be used as a decorator, a context manager, or directly in your tests to patch objects or methods.

**Example as a Decorator**:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('path.to.module.ClassName.method_name', return_value='mocked response')
def test_function(mocked_method):
    from path.to.module import ClassName
    assert ClassName.method_name() == 'mocked response'
    mocked_method.assert_called_once()
```

**Example as a Context Manager**:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

def test_function():
    with patch('path.to.module.ClassName.method_name', return_value='mocked response') as mocked_method:
        from path.to.module import ClassName
        assert ClassName.method_name() == 'mocked response'
        mocked_method.assert_called_once()
```

### Advanced Features

#### `side_effect` Attribute

You can use the `side_effect` attribute to raise exceptions or to dynamically change the return value based on the input arguments.

**Example**:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

def side_effect_func(*args, **kwargs):
    if args[0] == 'error':
        raise ValueError('error occurred')
    return 'response'

mocked_function = Mock(side_effect=side_effect_func)
print(mocked_function('success'))  # Prints: response
mocked_function('error')  # Raises: ValueError
```

#### `call_args` and `call_args_list`

These attributes allow you to inspect the arguments that the mock was called with.

**Example**:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

mocked_function = Mock()
mocked_function('first_call', key='value')
mocked_function('second_call', key='another value')

print(mocked_function.call_args)  # Prints the latest call args
print(mocked_function.call_args_list)  # Prints all call args
```

### Conclusion

The `unittest.mock` module is an essential tool for creating unit tests that require components to be isolated from their dependencies. By using `Mock`, `MagicMock`, and `patch`, you can simulate the behavior of almost any object, control their return values, assert their usage, and focus your tests on the logic you're trying to verify. This flexibility and control make `unittest.mock` invaluable for writing effective and reliable unit tests.

## Using The Mock Class

The `Mock` class in Python's `unittest.mock` module is a versatile and powerful tool for creating mock objects during unit testing. It enables you to simulate and control the behavior of dependencies within your code, making it easier to test components in isolation. Here's an in-depth look at using the `Mock` class, including some practical examples.

### Basic Usage of the Mock Class

At its core, a `Mock` object is a flexible dummy object that can simulate any other object. When you create a `Mock` instance, you can configure it to return specific values, raise exceptions, or even behave differently based on input parameters.

**Creating a Mock Object**:

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Create a mock object
mock_obj = Mock()
```

### Configuring Return Values

You can specify what a mock object should return when it is called. This is useful for simulating different scenarios that your code may encounter when interacting with a real object.

**Setting a Return Value**:

```python
mock_obj = Mock(return_value='fake response')
result = mock_obj()
print(result)  # Output: fake response
```

### Using Side Effects

The `side_effect` attribute allows you to define more complex behavior for a mock, such as raising exceptions or varying the return value based on the input.

**Raising Exceptions**:

```python
mock_obj = Mock(side_effect=Exception('An error occurred'))
# Calling mock_obj() will now raise the exception
```

**Dynamic Return Values Based on Input**:

```python
def my_side_effect(*args, **kwargs):
    if args[0] == 'special':
        return 'special response'
    else:
        return 'default response'

mock_obj = Mock(side_effect=my_side_effect)
print(mock_obj('special'))  # Output: special response
print(mock_obj('regular'))  # Output: default response
```

### Asserting Calls

`Mock` objects keep track of how they have been called, which allows you to make assertions about the interactions between your code and its dependencies.

**Asserting a Mock Was Called**:

```python
mock_obj()
mock_obj.assert_called()  # Passes, as mock_obj was called
```

**Asserting a Mock Was Called With Specific Arguments**:

```python
mock_obj('arg1', key='value')
mock_obj.assert_called_with('arg1', key='value')  # Passes
```

**Asserting the Number of Calls**:

```python
mock_obj()
mock_obj()
mock_obj.assert_called_once()  # Fails, as it was called twice
```

### Inspecting Calls

You can inspect the calls made to a mock object to verify their parameters and the order in which they were made.

**Inspecting Call Arguments**:

```python
mock_obj('test', 123)
print(mock_obj.call_args)  # Prints the arguments of the last call
```

**Inspecting All Calls**:

```python
mock_obj('first call')
mock_obj('second call')
print(mock_obj.call_args_list)  # Prints a list of all call arguments
```

### Resetting Mocks

In some cases, you may want to reset a mock to its initial state during a test.

**Resetting a Mock**:

```python
mock_obj('value')
mock_obj.reset_mock()
mock_obj.assert_not_called()  # Passes after reset
```

### Practical Example

Suppose you're testing a function that makes a network request. You can use a mock to simulate the network response, allowing you to test the function's behavior without making an actual network call.

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Function to test
def fetch_document(url):
    # Simulate network operation
    response = network_request(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.content
    else:
        return 'Error'

# Mocking the network request
network_request = Mock(return_value=Mock(status_code=200, content='Document content'))

# Testing the function
result = fetch_document('http://example.com')
print(result)  # Output: Document content
network_request.assert_called_with('http://example.com')
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `Mock` class to simulate a dependency (`network_request`) in a test, allowing you to control the behavior of the dependency and assert that it was used correctly. By mastering the `Mock` class and its features, you can write more effective and reliable unit tests for your Python code.
